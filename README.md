## FAQ

front not running ?
-> open navigator, type "localhost:4200" in bar

installation problem ?
check error message and install missing modules if mentionned

front running but no data appearing ?
-> insert before date and refresh
-> if still not working, check api error message, the api rate might be excedeed in which it is required to wait 


## additional info
